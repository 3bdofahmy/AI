The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

1. `docement Loading`: The app reads  documents and extracts their text content.

2. `Text Chunking`: The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

3. `Language Model`: The application utilizes a language model to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks.

4. `Similarity Matching`: When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

5. `Response Generation`: The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the docements.
